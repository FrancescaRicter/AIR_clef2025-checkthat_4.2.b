# CheckThat! CLEF 2025 â€“ Subtask 4b: Scientific Claim Source Retrieval

This repository contains our submission and experiments for the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab, **Subtask 4b â€“ Scientific Claim Source Retrieval**, which involves retrieving the correct scientific paper referenced implicitly in a tweet.

## Task Overview

Given a tweet that implicitly references a scientific publication, the goal is to retrieve the correct paper from a candidate pool derived from the CORD-19 dataset. This is framed as a document retrieval task evaluated using **MRR@5**.

## ðŸš€ Approaches

We implemented and compared the following pipelines:

### 1. Traditional Information Retrieval (BM25)
- Based on the `BM25Okapi` implementation from the `rank_bm25` library.
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, bigrams.
- Title field was emphasized (boosted) to improve retrieval performance.

### 2. Neural Representation Learning
- Used various pretrained sentence encoders (e.g., SciBERT, Specter2, Mixedbread).
- Best results were achieved using `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`.
- We explored contrastive fine-tuning using tweet-title and tweet-abstract pairs.

### 3. Neural Re-Ranking
- Used BM25 to retrieve top-30 documents.
- Applied pretrained cross-encoders (e.g., `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`, `bge-reranker-large`) for re-ranking.
- Achieved best performance with `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`.

## Performance Summary

| Approach                  | Dev MRR@5 |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| BM25 (Tuned)             | 0.638     |
| Neural Representation    | 0.607     |
| Neural Re-Ranking        | 0.626     |
| Challenge Submission     | 0.601     |

## Submission Format

The final `submission.tsv` file follows the required format:

```
post_id<TAB>[cord_uid1, cord_uid2, cord_uid3, cord_uid4, cord_uid5]
```

Each row contains a tweet ID and the top-5 predicted paper IDs sorted by relevance.

## Dependencies

To reproduce the results, install the following:

```bash
pip install rank_bm25 sentence-transformers transformers pandas nltk tqdm
```

For fine-tuning and re-ranking:
```bash
pip install accelerate datasets peft bitsandbytes
```
